## Project Overview


Project Overview

This Python application integrates with multiple database technologies to store and analyze data from the GitHub Archive dataset (GitHubArchive-Dataset.zip). Each part of the project introduces a new database, building toward a comprehensive understanding of how different data storage systems handle the same real-world data.

This is a five-part group project. Part 1 (Redis) and Part 2 (mongodb) are fully implemented. Parts 3–5 are placeholders and will be completed in future weeks.

| Part | Database  | Type                  | Status            |
|------|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 1    | Redis     | Key-Value (In-Memory) | Complete          |
| 2    | MongoDB   | Document              | completed         |
| 3    | Cassandra | Wide-Column           | Under Construction|
| 4    | Neo4j     | Graph                 | Under Construction|
| 5    | SQLite    | Relational            | Under Construction|


Dataset

This application uses Commits.json from the provided GitHubArchive-Dataset.zip. Each line of the file is one JSON object describing a single Git commit, with fields including:

| Field        | Description                                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `commit`     | The commit SHA — used as the unique Redis key              |
| `author`     | `{ "name": ..., "email": ... }` — who wrote the commit      |
| `committer`  | `{ "name": ..., "email": ... }` — who committed it          |
| `repo_name`  | A **list** containing the repository name(s), e.g. `["owner/repo"]` |
| `message`    | The full commit message                                    |
| `subject`    | The first line of the commit message                       |
| `parent`     | A list of parent commit SHA(s)                              |
| `tree`       | The tree SHA                                                |
The dataset ZIP also includes several other files (Files.json, Contents.json, Languages.json, Licenses.json, and Sample_* variants) describing repository file listings, file contents, language breakdowns, and license info. These are not used by the current Redis implementation but are used in later phases such as MongoDB.

File Responsibilities

menu.py — The only file you run. Displays the main database selection menu, routes to each database's submenu, and handles all user input and result display. As new databases are added in future weeks, new submenus are added here.

redis_crud.py — All core Redis functionality: establishing the connection, loading JSONL commit data from disk, normalizing the repo_name list field, and the four CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) keyed on commit SHA. Also imported by redis_features.py for helper functions.

redis_features.py — The three analytical features built on top of Redis data. Uses Redis sorted sets and lists to generate repository, keyword, and author analytics.

mongodb_crud.py — Handles MongoDB connection, dataset loading, and CRUD operations using PyMongo. Stores repository-level documents in a MongoDB collection.

mongodb_features.py — Implements analytical queries using MongoDB aggregation pipelines.

Part 1 — Redis Features

CRUD Operations

Create — Load commit records from Commits.json into Redis using pipelining for efficiency
Read — Retrieve commits by SHA
Update — Modify stored commit fields
Delete — Remove commits by SHA
List — Scan stored commit SHAs

Analytical Features

Feature 1 — Most Active Repositories
Counts commits per repository and stores results in a Redis Sorted Set. Displays a ranked leaderboard.

Feature 2 — Commit Keyword Frequency
Analyzes the first word of commit subject lines (e.g. Fix, Add, Update) and stores frequency in a Sorted Set.

Feature 3 — Author Contribution History
Tracks author commit activity using Redis lists and sorted sets to show top contributors and history.

## Redis Data Model

| Key Pattern              | Redis Type     | Description                                       |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `commit:<sha>`             | String (JSON)  | Full commit object stored as serialized JSON       |
| `ranking:repos`            | Sorted Set     | Repository names scored by total commit count      |
| `ranking:commit_keywords`  | Sorted Set     | Commit subject keywords scored by frequency        |
| `author:<name>:commits`    | List           | Ordered list of commit SHAs for a specific author  |
| `ranking:authors`          | Sorted Set     | Author names scored by total commit count          |

## Technology Requirements

| Requirement    | Details        |
|----------------|----------------|
| Language       | Python 3.8+    |
| Database       | Redis 6.0+     |

Part 2 — MongoDB Features

CRUD Operations

Create — Insert repository documents into MongoDB collection
Read — Query repositories by name, language, or metrics
Update — Modify repository attributes (watch_count, commits, language)
Delete — Remove repository documents by name

Analytical Features

Feature 1 — Top Watched Repositories
Uses MongoDB aggregation pipeline to rank repositories by watch_count

Feature 2 — Language Distribution
Groups repositories by programming language and counts occurrences

Feature 3 — Repository Activity Summary
Compares commits vs watch_count to evaluate repository engagement



MongoDB Data Model

Collection: repositories

Each document includes:
- repo_name
- watch_count
- language
- commits

MongoDB Technology Stack

- MongoDB 6.0+
- PyMongo driver
- Document-based NoSQL storage
- Aggregation pipelines for analytics

Dependencies

Install required packages:

pip install redis
pip install pymongo

Setup & Running the Application

1. Start MongoDB and Redis servers

Redis:
redis-server

MongoDB:
mongod

2. Run application

python menu.py

Recommended Workflow

Redis:
- Select option 1
- Load Commits.json
- Run analytics (options 6–9)

MongoDB:
- Select option 2
- Load Sample_repos.json
- Run CRUD and analytics features

Notes

- Redis uses JSON string storage with sorted sets for analytics
- MongoDB uses document storage with aggregation pipelines
- Both databases analyze related GitHub dataset structures but in different models
- Future phases will add Cassandra, Neo4j, and SQLite implementations
